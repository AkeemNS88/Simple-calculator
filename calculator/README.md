First build- 
    simple caluclator created

    Bugs to fix:
        -possibly add a clear button to remove all entries instead of deleting last entry
        -span showing result before = is pressed does not clear when last entry is deleted or starting over
        -when an operator is the final thing entered there is no functionality
